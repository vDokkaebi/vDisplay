# vDisplay
Previously the exploited AEL Displays, now given out as Open Source

## Introduction
These are my displays which have been running on the Airport Express Line for around two years and within the last year or so, we brought **KianTrains** onto the project, who ultimately exploited these displays after we, and the rest of the development team, fell out with him; so, I'm giving back to the community and I'm putting my displays on strict Open Source territory. This means that you're free to use this and modify the source code as much as you want; however you **must not** redistribute the source code as your own work. Please link my social links if you use these displays and feel free to contact me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/xSklzxDark) with what you've used my displays for and I may come onto your game and take a look.

## Important!
The "Monitor" part on the system **MUST** include the "Value" which is embedded within it.
Without this "Value", the displays will not work!

## How To Set Up
Setting up these displays can be a pain, however it's worth it for what you're given.

1. Create a GitHub account. (Use your ROBLOX username when possible, makes it easier for me.)
2. Click **Fork** at the top right of the repository, this will let me know who's using the displays and allow me to create a branch on the official repository for me to help out with anything code-related.
3. Download the zip by clicking on the **Clone or Download** button.
4. Click **Download Zip** and wait for the archive to download to your system.
5. Extract the archive to a folder of your choosing.
6. Open **Displays (rbxm)** and drag the file inside onto **ROBLOX Studio**. (This will insert the displays into your interface)
(Steps coming soon)

## FAQ

### Where are the audio files for the displays?
The folder named **Dependencies** has a load of **.txt** files named accordingly, these file names are what you must call your audio files in Studio; these **.txt** files only containing a rblxassetid. (These asset id's are the direct audio links)
